It is used in the restoration of historic buildings and eco-friendly constructions due to its breathable properties and ability to regulate humidity. It offers excellent breathability, preventing moisture buildup in walls. Its flexibility reduces the risk of cracks. Additionally, it is an eco-friendly and sustainable material, ideal for heritage restorations and bioclimatic constructions.",
